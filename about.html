    <p class="p-aboutme"> Hi there! My name is Rachel Settle. I'm a student at Duke University. I developed this website for my Web-Based Multimedia Communications class. I always knew I was looking for a creative career and after taking this class, I am excited to continue learning about user experience and coding. This website is created with HTML and CSS mainly, with a small amount of JavaScript. When this class ends, I plan to learn JavaScript fully and continue updating this site with new features I learn. Next semester I am taking Experimental Interface Design and Mobile Software Design. My goal is to master both front-end and back-end development.

		On this site you can find my resume, my portfolio, and my contact information. Enjoy!
