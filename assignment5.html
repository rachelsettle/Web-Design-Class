  <h1>Assignment 5: Web Graphics</h1>
<hr>
      <h2>Header Banner</h2>
      <img src="assignment5/iss_homepage.png" alt="Homepage Image" style="width:100%;">
      <p>This graphic will be the header banner for my home page and will fill the
        screen of the user. I want the user to be intrigued by the vibrant colors
        colors and simplicity of the design. Since this webpage is about me and
        my work, it seems fitting to have my name be the focus of the page.</p>


      <h2>Navigation Icons</h2>
        <nav class="navbar">
            <a><img src="assignment5/iss_navbar_aboutme_white.png" alt= "About Me" width= 33% onmouseover="this.src='assignment5/iss_navbar_aboutme_blue.png'" onmouseout="this.src='assignment5/iss_navbar_aboutme_white.png'" /></a>
            <a><img src="assignment5/iss_navbar_work_white.png" alt= "Work" width= 33% onmouseover="this.src='assignment5/iss_navbar_work_blue.png'" onmouseout="this.src='assignment5/iss_navbar_work_white.png'" /></a>
            <a><img src="assignment5/iss_navbar_contactme_white.png" alt= "Contact Me" width= 33% onmouseover="this.src='assignment5/iss_navbar_contactme_blue.png'" onmouseout="this.src='assignment5/iss_navbar_contactme_white.png'" /></a>
        </nav>
        <p>For the navigation bar, I wanted the hover over effect to be subtle. I decided to
        change the color of the text when hovering over. For this hover over effect
        I created two identical PNG images with the only the color of the text altered.
        Ideally, once my website is completed, the color will remain blue while
        the page is being browsed. This lets the user know their location
        within the site.</p>

        <h2>Animated Graphic Image</h2>
        <img src="http://i.makeagif.com/media/11-16-2016/QNM_rg.gif" alt="Arrow"></a><div>

        <p>I decided to create an animated graphic image online using a gif maker.
          Hopefully, I can create this gif with a transparent background.
          Ideally, I would put this animated graphic image at the bottom center of
          my header banner, suggesting the user scroll down. This ensures
          the user doesn't get stuck on top of the home page and knows
          there is more below.</p>
