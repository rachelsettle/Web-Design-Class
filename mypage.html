<h2>Interesting Facts About Me You Never Asked to Know</h2>
<h3>Disclaimer: <i>Not All Facts Are Real.</i></h3>
<!--Above creates the headings-->

<p>Welcome to <b>The Life of Rachel Settle.</b> The website, and <i>my first website</i>,
  that tells you about me! Some of these facts will be interesting, others, not so much.
  But who cares! I'm coding this webpage in HTML which is pretty darn cool. I'm
  hoping none of my friends find this webpage and use it to embarrass me, since I'm
  basically <i>talking to myself.</i> Coding is awesome<sup>2</sup>. The
   only reason I said that was so I could use superscript. Just kidding, coding
   is actually awesome, at least it is when you understand it. <b>Which I do!</b>
   <sup>(As of now.)</sup></p>

   <p>Okay, getting to the reason you're all here. My facts. Unless you're here
     grading my page for <b>Lab 2</b>, in that case, hello! And welcome!</p>

<p>If you care about where my education is coming from, check out <a href=
  "https://www.duke.edu/" target="_blank">this beautiful university.</a> (It's Duke if
  you're too lazy to click the link.) And yes, I did just code that link
   to open in a new tab. Had to read about <i>the target attribute.</i> <b>Learning
     is FUN!</b>
